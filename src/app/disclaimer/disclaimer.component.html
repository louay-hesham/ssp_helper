  <li>This web app is NOT affiliated with Alexandria University by any means.</li>
  <li>SSP Helper only shows you what courses you've met its prerequisites. That's all.</li>
  <li>There might be errors with the output of this app. Please revise your options with your advisor prior to actual registration.</li>
  <li>Be careful as sometimes the prerequisites of courses are changed without informing the students. So SSP Helper might not be updated to the latest changes yet. (Looking at you CAE students)</li>
  <li>Completing the prerequisites of a certain course doesn't mean you can register it. It might not open for registration afterall.</li>
